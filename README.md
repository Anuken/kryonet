![KryoNet](https://raw.github.com/wiki/EsotericSoftware/kryonet/images/logo.jpg)

A fork of [kryonet](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet/), a Java library that provides a clean and simple API for efficient network communication.

This version is made specifically for [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry). Kryo and JSON serialization have been removed in favor of custom serializers. 
RMI has also been removed. This fork is made to be as compact as possible, with no outside dependencies.
